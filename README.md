This project attempts to simulate perfect competition with a single good. In order to do that, it:
- Uses a pseudo demand schedule for a population, with demand changing based on whether the population can afford a "tier" of consumption (such as life needs, everyday needs, and luxury needs)
- Spawns multiple price-taker firms with fixed costs and constant variable costs, who gradually adjust their quantity produced through the price, can exit the market if their treasury depletes, or join the market if profits are high
- Uses a "Tatonnenment" mechanism to arrive at an equilibruim for prices and quantity supplied
- Simulates temporary supply shocks by raising variable costs
- Projects a dashboard in a locally hosted website to easily adjust model variables produce graphs of results
